## Database Schema

### New Tables Added

```sql
-- Quiz Types (Random, Topical, Termly)
quiz_types: id, title, description, code, created_at

-- Question Types (MCQ, Short Answer, True/False)  
question_types: id, title, description, code, created_at

-- Enhanced Quizzes
quizzes: id, title, examination_system_id, level_id, subject_id, 
         quiz_type_id, term_id, topic_id, question_count, time_limit

-- Quiz Questions
quiz_questions: id, quiz_id, content, question_type_id, marks, 
                difficulty, explanation, order_index

-- Quiz Question Choices
quiz_question_choices: id, quiz_question_id, content, is_correct, order_index

-- Enhanced Quiz Sessions (with snapshots)
enhanced_quiz_sessions: id, quiz_id, user_id, profile_id, quiz_questions (JSONB),
                        start_time, end_time, total_questions, correct_answers,
                        total_marks, marks_obtained, sparks_earned, accuracy_percentage

-- Quiz Question Answers
quiz_question_answers: id, quiz_session_id, quiz_question_id, 
                       quiz_question_choice_id, answer, is_correct, marks, sparks
```

### Key Benefits of This Schema

1. **Question Snapshots**: `quiz_questions` JSONB field stores exact questions at session start
2. **Flexible Choices**: Separate `quiz_question_choices` table for scalability
3. **Multiple Attempts**: Each session is separate, allowing retakes
4. **Analytics Ready**: Detailed answer tracking for performance insights
5. **Marks vs Sparks**: Separate academic marks and gamification points

## API Endpoints

### Quiz Management
```
POST   /api/quizzes/generate          # Generate new quiz
GET    /api/quiz-sessions/:id         # Get quiz session details
POST   /api/quiz-sessions/:id/answers # Submit answer
POST   /api/quiz-sessions/:id/complete # Complete quiz
GET    /api/quiz-types                # Get available quiz types
```

### Response Examples

#### Quiz Generation
```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "message": "Quiz generated successfully"
}
```

#### Quiz Session Details
```json
{
  "id": "session-uuid",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "question-uuid",
      "content": "What is photosynthesis?",
      "questionType": "mcq",
      "marks": 1,
      "choices": [
        {"id": "choice-1", "content": "Process of making food", "isCorrect": true},
        {"id": "choice-2", "content": "Process of breathing", "isCorrect": false}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "timeLimit": 30,
  "totalQuestions": 15
}
```

## Quiz Generation Logic

### 1. Random Quiz Generation
- Selects questions from all topics within subject/level
- Applies difficulty distribution (30% easy, 50% medium, 20% hard)
- Ensures topic diversity
- Randomizes question order

### 2. Topical Quiz Generation
- Focuses on specific topic
- Progressive difficulty (easy → medium → hard)
- Comprehensive topic coverage
- Concept reinforcement

### 3. Termly Quiz Generation
- Covers entire term content
- Balanced topic representation
- Assessment-oriented questions
- Cumulative learning evaluation

## Sparks Calculation System

```typescript
SPARKS = {
  EASY_QUESTION: 5,
  MEDIUM_QUESTION: 10, 
  HARD_QUESTION: 15,
  COMPLETION_BONUS: 20,
  PERFECT_SCORE_BONUS: 50
}

// Example: 15 questions (5 easy, 7 medium, 3 hard) with 80% accuracy
// Base sparks: (5×5 + 7×10 + 3×15) = 140
// Completion bonus: 20
// Total: 160 sparks
```

## Session Management Workflow

### 1. Quiz Initialization
```
1. User selects quiz parameters
2. System generates quiz record
3. Questions selected and stored in quiz_questions
4. Quiz session created with JSON snapshot
5. Session ID returned to frontend
```

### 2. Quiz Execution  
```
1. Frontend fetches session details
2. User answers questions sequentially
3. Each answer submitted immediately
4. Progress tracked in real-time
5. Time limits enforced
```

### 3. Quiz Completion
```
1. Final submission triggered
2. Results calculated (marks, sparks, accuracy)
3. Profile stats updated
4. Session marked complete
5. Results displayed to user
```
