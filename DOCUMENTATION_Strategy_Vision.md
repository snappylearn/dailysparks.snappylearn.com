- Building an ecosystem where learning is co-created, not top-down.

### 3. **Global Playgrounds** (Social Layer)

- Leaderboards, group quests, live challenges.
- "Study with me" multiplayer sparks.
- Learning becomes a global adventure, not a lonely task.

### 4. **AI-Powered Personalization** (Adaptive Core)

- AI adapts sparks to each learner's level, mood, and progress.
- A smart feed: "Your Next Spark" → like a personalized flow of quests.
- Balances engagement and mastery so learners grow while having fun.
