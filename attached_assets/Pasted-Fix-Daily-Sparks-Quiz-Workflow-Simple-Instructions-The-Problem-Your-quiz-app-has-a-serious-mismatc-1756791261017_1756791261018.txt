Fix Daily Sparks Quiz Workflow - Simple Instructions
The Problem
Your quiz app has a serious mismatch:

Users select Physics Form 1 Term 1
But get Geography questions like "What is the capital of Kenya?"
Only 2 questions show up instead of 15
Questions repeat and don't come from your admin backend

What Needs to Happen
1. STOP Using Fake Questions

Your frontend is showing questions that don't exist in your admin panel
DELETE any hardcoded questions in your frontend code
The quiz must ONLY show questions that admins have added to the backend

2. Fix the Question Flow
Current broken flow:

User picks Physics Form 1 Term 1
Frontend shows random questions from nowhere
Questions don't match the selection

Correct flow should be:

User picks Physics Form 1 Term 1
Frontend asks backend: "Give me 15 Physics Form 1 Term 1 questions"
Backend finds ONLY Physics Form 1 Term 1 questions from admin panel
Backend sends back exactly 15 questions that match
Frontend shows these questions one by one

3. Simple Backend Fix
When someone starts a quiz, your backend must:

Check: What subject? (Physics)
Check: What form? (Form 1)
Check: What term? (Term 1)
Find questions that match ALL THREE
Count them - if less than 15, show error "Not enough questions available"
If 15 or more exist, pick exactly 15
Send these 15 to frontend

4. Simple Frontend Fix
Your frontend must:

Never show questions unless they come from backend API
Always verify each question matches what user selected
If question doesn't match, show error and go back to dashboard
Show exactly 15 questions, no more, no less

5. Admin Panel Check
Go to your admin panel and verify:

Do you have 15+ Physics questions for Form 1 Term 1?
Are they properly labeled as "Physics" subject?
Are they properly labeled as "Form 1" level?
Are they properly labeled as "Term 1"?

If NO - add more questions with correct labels
If YES - the problem is in your API connection
6. Quick Test Steps

Add 20 Physics Form 1 Term 1 questions in admin panel
Start Physics Form 1 Term 1 quiz
Verify EVERY question shown is actually Physics
Verify you get exactly 15 different questions
Try again - should get different random 15 questions

7. Error Messages to Add

"Sorry, not enough questions available for this combination"
"Error: Question doesn't match your selection. Returning to menu"
"Failed to load questions. Please try again"

Simple Rule
If admin hasn't added it to the backend, users shouldn't see it in the quiz.
The geography question about Kenya's capital should NOT appear in a Physics quiz because:

It's not Physics
It probably doesn't exist in your admin questions
Your system is pulling from wrong source

Fix this by making frontend and backend talk to each other properly, with the backend only sending questions that match exactly what the user selected.
